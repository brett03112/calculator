# A SimpleCalculator in JavaScript

This project is a simple web-based calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations for performing calculations.

## Responsiveness

The calculator is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout and appearance to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The layout adjusts to ensure usability across various devices.

## Limitations

This calculator is a basic implementation and has the following limitations:

* It currently only supports fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* It does not handle complex mathematical functions or scientific notation.
* There is no support for parentheses or order of operations beyond simple left-to-right evaluation.
* It lacks features such as memory functions, calculation history, or advanced error handling for invalid inputs like division by zero.
